#### ML Demo Project
#### Process Steps
The first task in the project is to set up the Github Repository and creation of virtual environment. 
    -   The repository is created as ML-Demo-project.
    -   The virtual environment is created as mlenv.
    -   We cloned the github repo in our local folder address
    -   environment created with " conda create -p mlenv python==3.10 -y" syntax
    -   environment created at the envs location for anaconda

We can check if our github repository is synced with the project - "git remote -v"

The output as we got - 
origin  https://github.com/Csengupta1101/ML-Project-Demo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Csengupta1101/ML-Project-Demo.git (push)

So it's in sync we can say.
